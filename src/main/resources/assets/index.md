## Table of contents

Introduction to the tools we will use and approach

- Before everything we will need [IntelliJ](/help_intellij#downloading) to do some coding
- A bit of [motivation](/intro) around java :coffee:

Basic weapons :hammer: and tools :wrench: for solving first tier of tasks

- First [program](/basics#first-program)
- Setting up [project](/help_intellij#create-new-project)
- Running [project](/help_intellij#running-project) :running:
- [Importing](/help_intellij#import-local-project)

First code!

- [Declarations/Assignments](/basics#declarations--assignments)
- [Arithmetic operations](/basics#arithmetic-operations)
- [Operations with if/else](/basics#statements)
- [Operations with loops](/basics#loops)
- [Operations with strings](/basics#strings)
- [Common operations for the exercises](/other#basics)
- [Practice with statements](/tasks_lt#simple-statements)
- [Practice with loops](/tasks_lt#cycles)
- Cool project on creating a (not) boring [Guessing game](/projects#guessing-game)

Updating project with GIT!

- **Missing** [GIT](/help_git) documentation :(

Putting things into little buckets

- Fill up those [arrays](/collections#arrays)
- Practice with [arrays](/tasks_lt#arrays)

First steps in structurizing the code for easier complex problem solving

- More [methods](/structure#methods) in a class!
- Practice with [methods](/tasks_lt#methods)
- Project on creating a cool [ATM](/projects#atm-machine) machine!

Adding external resources to the mix!

- How to read [from file](/other#reading-from-file)
- Exercises using [file reading](/tasks_lt#reading-file)

More things to bigger and better buckets

- Collecting data in [lists](/collections#lists)
- Exercises with [lists](/tasks_lt#lists)
- Mapping data in [maps](/collections#maps) (dictionaries)
- Exercises with [maps](/tasks_lt#maps)

First steps in object oriented world :house:

- [Basic structure of classes and their usage](/classes#classes)
- More info about [variables](/classes#classes) and their types
- [Exercises for basic class usage](/tasks_lt#classes--methods)
- Project on creating cool game for hanging people for incorrect answer (joking) - [The hangman](/projects#hangman-game)

More info on class usage

- Hiding things from outside world in a class by using [encapsulation](/classes#encapsulation)
- Creating different kind of classes by using different [constructors](/classes#constructors)
- [Static](/classes#static-methods) methods in a class
- Referencing correct variables by using [this](/classes#this) keyword
- Putting things together and assembling a simplified version of game [The Battleships](/projects#battle-ship)

Even more knowledge expanding on using classes

- Reusing method names in a class by [overloading](/classes#method-overloading)
- More versatile class by creating different constructors with [overloading](/classes#constructor-overloading)
- Special type of classes - [enums](/classes#enums)
- Practice using [overloading](/tasks_lt#classes-overloading)

Expanding class above and beyond with

- Class [inhericance](/tasks_lt#inheritance)
- Exercises with [inhericance](/tasks_lt#inheritance)
- Class [interfaces](/tasks_lt#interfaces)
- Exercises with [inhericance](/tasks_lt#interfaces)
